# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project has been completed by Alexander Van-Nugent, a student from the LHL Web Flex Bootcamp.

Using a provided respository as practice code, students are expected to build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

### Tweeter provides the following functions for the user:
- See updates to form data POST's in Tweeter timeline without refreshing
- Error code reminders for no text written or over character limit (max 140 characters)
- Responsive design view for general desktop/laptop dimensions and mobile devices such as phones/tablets
